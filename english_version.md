## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

<a id="where"></a>
- **Where do we play?**

  We usually meet at Polideportivo Benimaclet (_indoor court - pay to use_). 
  
  However, sometimes we meet in free public outdoor courts in different parts of the city.

<a id="how-often"></a>
- **How often do we play?**
  
  We usually meet on weekends, for now.

  We would like to organize games during the week as well, but we have not been able to do it yet.

<a id="how-long"></a>
- **For how long do we play?**
  
  We usually play for 60 minutes, 90 minutes or 120 minutes.

<a id="how-many"></a>
- **What is the player limit?**

  Up to 15 players if we play for 60 minutes.
  
  If we play for longer, up to 20.

<a id="how-much"></a>
- **How much does it cost?**

  When we reserve at Polideportivo Benimaclet (_indoor court - pay to use_) the price ranges from €3 to €4, depending on the amount of time we book and the number of players.
  
  You will have to give the playing fee to the organizer (cash preferred). Don´t bring big notes, we are not a bank.
  
  When we play in _free public courts_, then there is no cost (it's free!)

<a id="how-to"></a>
- **How do I sign up to play?**

  In our [Telegram group](https://linktr.ee/valencianets) we make a list of a maximum of 20 players, if there is free spot, put your name on the list. Then head to indicated place when the time comes.

  This list is mostly to know who and how many of us will be going, so that we can also book the place for more or less time according to the amount of attendees.

<a id="bring"></a>
- **What should I bring?**

  If you have any, you could bring a ball, an air pump, water and cash to pay forthe reservation (if applicable).

<a id="can-i"></a>
- **Can I organize a game?**

  Any member of the group can organize a game whenever they wish.

<a id="pol-ben-booking"></a>
- **Polideportivo Benimaclet - how far in advance can I reserve?**

  Earliest is Tuesdays morning. 
  
  On Tuesdays you can call Polideportivo Benimaclet and check the availability for the week. The reservation must be made in person at the reception.

  Federated teams and schools that use the place have priority of usage. Monday nights these institutions reserve the time slots for them. Whatever is left, would be available for us.
